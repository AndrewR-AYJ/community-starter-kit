### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Need a programmer to help develop the program.
- **qa-needed**: Need a quality insurance detector to make sure program works as intended.
- **documentation-needed**: Need somone to help document updates and new commits.
- **bug-high-priority**: Need someone to fix high priority bugs detected by the qa.
- **bug-low-priority**: Need someone to fix low priority bugs detected by the qa.
- **help-wanted**: This is for help with miscellanious things that will come up during the project or presently exist.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
